# Recipe-generator-hackathon

Your task today is to create a recipe generator by fetching from an API. We have written some instructions to help you, but feel free to expand on these and add any additional features you would like in order to create the best application you can.

Sign up to the free tier of the spoonacular API here
[spoonacular API](https://link-url-here.org).
Click on Start Now and Sign-up and then check your email to allow access.

To get your Api Key, sign in then click on `MY CONSOLE` button then click `profile` take note of this API key which we will use at a later point.

Now use this [Api](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Authentication) to fetch data into your app.

for example :
`https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/search?apiKey=${"YourAPIKeyGoesHere"}&number=1&query=${"FoodSearchGoesHere"}`
